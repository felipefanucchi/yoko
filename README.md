# TASK EXECUTOR

This is a package with dependencies to help smoother and more useful development.

For now you must follow the patterns and mass structure manually.

[Use this mass structure for SCSS](https://github.com/felipefanucchi/pulso-test)


### Prerequisites
It will have the ```EditNode```` and the ```editConfig`` plugin, as there will always be a **Node```````editorconfig file.

### Installing

Install project dependencies.

```
npm install || npm me
```

Then

```
sip
```

### Starting

To start with a good development, we must follow some good practices, which are them, in my opinion.

* ```Git``` for project versioning;
* ```Npm``` to control project information;
* ```Gulp``` to automate tasks, like ```scss, minify, codeclean, autoprefixers ``` and etc...;
* ```gitignore`` as we don't want our ``node_modules``` folder in our area, eg.


### Encoding style

This package will follow a development pattern, they are, for a modular development of the project.
